# Tiny ShotGrid.
A toy project to implement a basic version of Autodesk ShotGrid using [tinydb](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

## Usage
`tinysg` provides an API almost identical to the core ShotGrid [Python API](https://developer.shotgridsoftware.com/python-api/index.html). 

Due to the [limitations](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#why-not-use-tinydb) of tinydb, it is not recommended for production use. However, it can be used as a backend for other toy projects, or to practice against, in lieu of setting up your own ShotGrid instance.

## Requirements
Requires Python 3.6 or higher.
